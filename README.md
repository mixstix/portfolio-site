# portfolio-site
This is the first site I've designed and coded from scratch.

Started with the <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com">Skeleton</a> CSS framework which I really enjoyed working with because it was so customizable. Haven't gotten around to using Boostrap yet but I imagine that I'll be working with this framework a lot. 

This is also my first fully responsive site. Looking forward to hear people's feedback about this!
